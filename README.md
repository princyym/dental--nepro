**## Final Future Ready Talent Project by Shubham Singh.
## Main Idea of this project is: Dental web applications often struggle with low user engagement and conversion rates due to unclear value propositions, poor user experience, and lack of trust-building elements. Many dental web apps fail to effectively communicate their unique services and benefits, leading to user confusion and high bounce rates. Additionally, issues like slow loading times, non-intuitive navigation, and insufficient mobile responsiveness further deter potential patients. Without prominent calls to action, patient testimonials, and detailed service information, these apps miss opportunities to build credibility and facilitate easy appointment bookings, ultimately impacting patient acquisition and retention.
